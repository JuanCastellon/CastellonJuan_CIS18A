Comments : Surprised at the sudden shift towards a more mathematically conceptual homework problem. It was difficult at first for me since I usually don't use the mod operator, but as soon as I got the gears turning it was a breeze. I just hoped I used the boolean correctly in my program since I don't really know all that much about the coding etiquette like I learned with Professor Lehr in CSC 5.
