Comments: I was a little confused at first when NetBeans told me that putting my newly made class in the default package was not recommended, so I had to go look that up online since the book didn't really mention anything about a default package. I learned to keep them together and I thought that was strange because there isn't any issues like that concerning classes in C++.
